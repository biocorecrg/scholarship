## Heatmaps

This tool allows you to generate and customize heatmaps.<br>
The main input is a text file of numbers (e.g. gene expression), with at least one column of annotation. The tool is able to detect the non-numerical columns and proposes them as annotation<br>
The data frame should not contain more than 10000 rows. If it does, you can select an annotation's column to make a selection of genes to display: you can upload a file with a selection of genes in order to filter the data. You can also directly paste the selection in the text area.<br>
The "display" button will be disabled if both the data frame and the gene selection have more than 2000 rows.
Further customization:
* Choose the colors: lower, middle and upper
* Scale the data by row or by column
* Hide row label
* Change the size of the labels.
Once you click on display, just wait (depending on the size of the input, clustering can take a bit of time). Clicking again will hide the download options.<br>
You can select the format of the file you want to save the plot in, or directly download png of the graph in the plot widget.<br>
For every tool you can **save the session** and restore it later on, using the provided link from "Save Session" button.
